# Q-Learning-Project

This project makes a maze using Q-Learning.

##1. What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
###a. Q learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the most desirable set of decisions to achieve a given outcome.
###b. The Q stands for quality--learning the quality of certain decisions versus others
###c. Learning obviously stands for machine learning which at this point is pretty self explanatory.
##2. What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
###a. RL is a form of deep learning--progress by trial and error vs ML which is learning by pattern recognition
###b. A set of states and a set of actions
i. By performing actions, we move from state to state
ii. The better the action is, the more of a reward the algorithm gets
iii. The goal is to attain the highest reward possible
###c. This relates to machine learning because it learns by favoring certain moves in order to gain more of a reward.
##3. What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
###a. Model free is a Markov Decision Process that does not use the “reward function”. Instead, the trial and error becomes the reward function.
##4. What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
###a. Google’s DeepMind used it to play classic video games with the goal of achieving the highest score possible.
###b. Atari 2600
###c. This project!
